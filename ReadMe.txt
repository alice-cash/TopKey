TopKey is a Keyboard broadcasting software.
It originally design was for World of Warcraft, and as one of my personal tools, so it is not laid out like a normal application.

For those of you who need to ask, yes this a legal tool to use for WoW. There are many other tools like this one out there, though many of the good ones are not free.

A good source of information on multi-boxing can be found here: http://www.wowwiki.com/Multiboxing

Please note though, that use of this or any other keyboard broadcasting software may not be allowed for any other game other than WoW, and should this break the EULA/TOS in a future update, then it will be modified or taken town to comply with the changes. Always go over the EULA and TOS of any Application you use this with, as i am not responsible or liable for any losses you encounter.

Please read over the Licence.txt before using this product.
