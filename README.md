======TopKey======
The latest version can be found here: http://www.stormraidergames.com/TopKey
TopKey is a Keyboard broadcasting software.
It originally design was for World of Warcraft and as one of my personal tools it is not laid out like a normal application.

As of  on November 3, 2020, Blizzard no longer allows "the use of all software and hardware mechanisms to mirror commands to multiple World of Warcraft accounts at the same time, or to automate or streamline multi-boxing in any way." 

~~For those of you who need to ask, yes this a legal tool to use for WoW. There are many other tools like this one out there, though many of the good ones are not free.-

A good source of information on multi-boxing can be found here: http://www.wowwiki.com/Multiboxing

Please note though, that use of this or any other keyboard broadcasting software may not be allowed for any other game other than WoW, and should this break the EULA/TOS in a future update, then it may be modified or taken town to comply with the changes. Always go over the EULA and TOS of any Application you use this with, as i am not responsible or liable for any losses you encounter.~~

Please read over the Licence.txt before using or distributing this product.

======Instructions======

Use is fairly simple. You have 2 main windows, The main Keyboard window and the Process List window.

The main keyboard window is accessable via a button at the top of the screen. Clicking this will cause it to pop down, then reclicking will cause it to re-hide.

Profiles can be changed, Created or Deleted via the controls on the bottm left.
Changing a profile will save its settings although you can force a save via the "Save All" button.

To enable or disable keys, click on them. Black keys are disabled and Blue keys are enabled.

To set a profile hotkey, Press the "Hotkey" button, then select the button or combination of buttons that should be pressed.

The Process window is fairly simple. 

The top listbox lists the current processes that the app is broadcasting too.
The dropdown box is the processes that have been found. They are in the form of
ProcessID-Program Filename-Main Window Title

Below that you have the search box and button. This will match either the main window title or file name of the process.

Last is the Add button.

======Changelog======
1.1 - Added Profile Hotkeys. These allow you to quickly change between keyboard profiles.
